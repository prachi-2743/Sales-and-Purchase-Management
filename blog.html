<p class="sectiontag text-bg">What is Purchasing Management System?
</p> 
<p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The Purchasing Information System can be used at a variety of levels in the decision-making process as an instrument for monitoring, controlling and planning your business operations.
It is a flexible tool for collecting, aggregating and analyzing data from Purchasing. The information system allows you to view all information in the operative application from a wide range of perspectives. 
You can also define the level of detail in which you wish to see the information.
The Purchasing Information System contains informative key figures which help you to detect and appraise changes and trends at an early stage. 
This means that you can permanently monitor key criteria and are in a position to take necessary action in good time.
The data is evaluated either by means of standard analyses or flexible analyses. Flexible planning, 
the Early Warning System and the Logistics Information Library are integrated in the Purchasing Information System.
Tools are available in Customizing, which allow you to apply a self-defined structure to your information system and tailor it to meet your own specific requirements.
The Purchasing Information System is part of the Logistics Information System (LIS), which also includes the Sales Information System and Inventory Controlling.
